# rShell
CS100 command shell called rshell in C++

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Clone, make, and run rShell
----------------------------

```console
username@hostname$ git clone https://github.com/taimaruuu/rshell.git
username@hostname$ cd rshell
username@hostname$ ./bin/rhsell
```

Information
------------

This is a shell that takes bash commands and works just like another shell would
work. For now we only have certain commands working.

Only commands found in /bin can be used. Commands can be found by:

```console
username@hostname$ ls -l /bin
```
The user can decide to exit our shell anytime with the following command:

```console
username@hostname$ exit
```

Bugs
-----

* Still trying to figure things out for parsing with multiple commands.
* Certain commands are creating issues:

```console
username@hostname$ echo "double quote test"
username@hostname$ echo 'single quote test'
username@hostname$ mkdir dir_test
username@hostname$ touch touch_test
```
